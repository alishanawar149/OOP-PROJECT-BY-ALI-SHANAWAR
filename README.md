##  Project Description

The **SAOS University Portal** is a role-based, multi-user console application that simulates a real-world university academic management system. The system supports three distinct user roles — **Students**, **Faculty**, and **Admins** — each with a dedicated portal and specific capabilities.

Built without STL containers (no `vector`, no `map`), the system instead uses raw arrays with manual size tracking, demonstrating mastery of low-level C++ memory and data management. Data is persisted across sessions using structured `.txt` flat-files, and the entire codebase is organized into a clean modular architecture with separate header and source files for every class.

##  Key Use Cases and Testing

---

###  Key Use Cases:

### 1.  Student Enrollment & Course Management
Students can browse available courses and self-enroll (up to 5 courses). Admins can also enroll or remove courses on a student's behalf. Duplicate enrollment and over-enrollment are both guarded with validation errors.

### 2.  Fee Payment System
Students can view their current outstanding fee balance and make partial or full payments using an overloaded `-=` operator. The system prevents overpayments and invalid (zero or negative) amounts.

### 3.  Attendance Marking (Single & Bulk)
Faculty can mark attendance for individual students or switch to **Bulk Entry Mode** to process an entire class at once by entering roll numbers sequentially. The system enforces that a student must be formally enrolled in a course before attendance can be recorded for it.

### 4.  Grade Assignment & Transcript Viewing
Faculty can assign letter grades (A+, A, B-, etc.) to enrolled students for courses they teach. Students can view their official formatted transcript at any time, showing all enrolled courses and their current grades.

### 5.  Faculty Salary Management & Redemption
Admins can credit salary payments to individual faculty members. Faculty can then view their credited balance and redeem any portion of it — with validation to prevent over-redemption or invalid amounts.

### 6.  Persistent Data Storage Across Sessions
All student records (courses, attendance, grades, fee balances), faculty data (assigned courses, salary), and admin credentials are automatically saved to `.txt` files on logout and reloaded on the next startup — ensuring no data is lost between sessions.

### 7.  Role-Based Access Control
The system enforces strict access boundaries. Faculty can only mark attendance and assign grades for courses they are assigned to teach. All login attempts are validated against stored credentials before granting portal access.

### Testing:

### 1.  Student Enrollment & Course Management
Students can browse available courses and self-enroll (up to 5 courses). Admins can also enroll or remove courses on a student's behalf. Duplicate enrollment and over-enrollment are both guarded with validation errors.

### 2.  Fee Payment System
Students can view their current outstanding fee balance and make partial or full payments using an overloaded `-=` operator. The system prevents overpayments and invalid (zero or negative) amounts.

| Test cases 2.1:Khunais baig trying to overpay | Test case 2.2:khuais baig paid 100000pkr |

### 3.  Attendance Marking (Single & Bulk)
Faculty can mark attendance for individual students or switch to **Bulk Entry Mode** to process an entire class at once by entering roll numbers sequentially. The system enforces that a student must be formally enrolled in a course before attendance can be recorded for it.

| Test cases 3.1:Marking for individual | Test case 3.2:Marking for bulk |

### 4.  Grade Assignment & Transcript Viewing
Faculty can assign letter grades (A+, A, B-, etc.) to enrolled students for courses they teach. Students can view their official formatted transcript at any time, showing all enrolled courses and their current grades.

| Test cases 4.1:Grading An assignment of Habib | Test case 4.2:Viewing transcript Habib got A+ (boom) |

### 5.  Faculty Salary Management & Redemption
Admins can credit salary payments to individual faculty members. Faculty can then view their credited balance and redeem any portion of it — with validation to prevent over-redemption or invalid amounts.

| Test cases 5.1:Admin giving Salary | Test case 5.2:Faculty redeming salary |

### 6.  Persistent Data Storage Across Sessions
All student records (courses, attendance, grades, fee balances), faculty data (assigned courses, salary), and admin credentials are automatically saved to `.txt` files on logout and reloaded on the next startup — ensuring no data is lost between sessions.

### 7.  Role-Based Access Control
The system enforces strict access boundaries. Faculty can only mark attendance and assign grades for courses they are assigned to teach. All login attempts are validated against stored credentials before granting portal access.

## Core OOP Concepts Applied

| Concept | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Encapsulation** | All data members (`salary`, `feeDue`, `password`) are `private`/`protected`, accessed only via getters and setters |
| **Inheritance** | Multi-level hierarchy: `Account` → `User` → `Employee` → `Faculty` / `Admin`, and `User` → `Student` |
| **Polymorphism** | `viewDashboard()` is a pure virtual function in `User`, overridden distinctly in `Student`, `Faculty`, and `Admin` |
| **Abstraction** | `User` is an abstract class (pure virtual `viewDashboard()`); `Account` serves as the authentication base interface |
| **Operator Overloading** | `Student::operator-=` for fee payment; `Course::operator==` for enrollment duplicate checks |
| **Friend Classes** | `Faculty` and `Admin` are declared `friend` in `Student` for controlled direct-array access (e.g., attendance marking) |
| **File I/O** | `FileManager` uses a fully static interface to serialize/deserialize all entities to/from structured flat-files |

##  How to Use the System

When launched, the system presents the main login screen:

```
==============================
 Welcome to SAOS Portal
==============================
1. Student
2. Faculty
3. Admin
4. Exit System
Select Role:
```

###  Default Login Credentials

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Admin | `admin@saos.edu` | `admin123` |
| Faculty | `fatima@saos.edu` | `fac123` |
| Student | `abdullah@saos.edu` | `pass123` |

> These credentials are loaded from the `.txt` files on startup. If the files are missing or empty, the system auto-creates one default user per role.

##  Assumptions & Limitations

- **No STL Containers:** The system deliberately avoids `vector`, `map`, and other STL containers. All collections use fixed-size C-style arrays with manual index counters, as required by the course constraints.

- **Fixed Capacity Limits:** A student can enroll in a maximum of **5 courses** and store up to **100 attendance records**. Faculty can be assigned a maximum of **5 courses**. The system supports up to **100 students**, **50 faculty**, and **10 admins** loaded in memory at once.

- **Roll Number Format:** Student roll numbers must strictly follow the `XXK-XXXX` format (e.g., `24K-0001`). The system will display a warning during object creation if the format is invalid.

- **Date Format:** Dates for attendance records should be entered in `DD/MM/YYYY` format (e.g., `19/02/2026`). No automatic date validation is enforced beyond what the user enters.

- **Data Persistence:** All data is stored in plain-text `.txt` files (`students.txt`, `faculty.txt`, `admins.txt`) in the same directory as the executable. The program must have **read and write permissions** in its working directory.

- **Save on Logout:** Data is saved automatically when a user selects Logout. If the program is closed abruptly (e.g., via terminal interrupt), unsaved changes from the current session will be lost.

- **Password Security:** Passwords are stored and compared as plain text. This is intentional for the scope of this academic project and is not intended for production use.

- **Compiler Standard:** The project requires `C++11` or higher due to the use of range-based features and string utilities. Compilation with older standards will produce errors.
